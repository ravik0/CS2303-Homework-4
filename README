	This is a simulation of ants and doodlebugs. Doodlebugs are denoted by "x"'s on the game board, while ants
are denoted by "o"'s on the board. 
	Doodlebugs always move before the ants, and have 3 actions. They can move into
a cell, which can either be occupied by an ant (which it then eats) or not occupied at all. They can also starve if
they have not eaten after 3 time steps. Finally, doodlebugs can also breed after surviving for 8 time steps. They must
breed into an open cell. If a doodlebug starves, it can not breed.
	Ants have 2 actions. They can move into a cell, which must be unoccupied. They can also breed after surviving
for 3 time steps. They must breed into an open cell. An ant can not starve, it can only be eaten.
	To run the program, you can give it up to 6 arguments in this fashion:
/Ants gridSize #doodlebugs #ants #generations seed pause
gridSize denotes the length of one side of the square that the game happens it. Its default value is 20.
#doodlebugs denotes the amount of doodlebugs that start. Its default value is 5.
#ants denotes the amount of ants that start. Its default value is 100.
#generations denotes the amount of time steps that the program will run. Its default value is 1000
seed is the seed that the program will use to randomize the values. Its default value is 1.
pause can be any integer, any nonzero integer forces the program to wait for user input before continuing. Its default value is 0.
